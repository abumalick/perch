# Shared test gate for the pre-commit / pre-merge-commit / pre-push hooks. Runs
# the full suite; a non-zero exit aborts the git operation that invoked it.
#
# WHY three hooks share this: `pre-commit` alone does NOT gate `main`. Git runs
# `pre-commit` only for `git commit` — never for merge commits (that's
# `pre-merge-commit`), never for fast-forward merges (no commit at all), and
# never when a ref is moved directly (`git update-ref`/`git push`). Merges are
# this repo's dominant integration path, so the merge + push hooks are what
# actually keep red code off `main` and `origin`.
#
# Arg 1 is the hook name, used only for the log line.
