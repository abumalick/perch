// `reconnecting` is distinct from `unreachable`: a machine that has connected before is known
// reachable and auto-retries forever, so we show a calm "Reconnecting…" indefinitely rather
// than the alarming "Can't reach your machines" (which is reserved for a machine that has
// never connected this session). `anyReconnecting` is sticky per session, so it doesn't
// flicker with the backoff connecting<->offline cycle.
